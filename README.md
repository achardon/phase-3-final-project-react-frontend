# Bike Ride Tracker

## Installation
This app is a React frontend/Sinatra backend project. Use npm install && npm start for the frontend. For the backend, there is a separate repository which can be found here: 'https://github.com/achardon/phase-3-final-project-sinatra-backend'. Both are required for this app to function properly. 

## Description
Use this app to track your bike rides. There are routes pre-coded into this app that you can choose from, or you can add your own custom ride. Every time you add a new ride, you can include details about the ride. If you choose a pre-coded route, it will automatically store the distance and other route details for you. On the 'Riders' page, you can see each rider with their corresponding bike rides to date. Use the 'Add Ride' page to add a new ride. You can easily edit or delete rides on the 'Riders' page. There is also a 'Goals' page, where you can keep track of any goals you have. You can easily add and delete goals as well.
