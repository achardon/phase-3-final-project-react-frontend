# Bike Ride Tracker

## Installation
This app is a React frontend/Sinatra backend project. Use npm install && npm start for the frontend. For the backend, there is a separate repository which can be found here: 'https://github.com/achardon/phase-3-final-project-sinatra-backend'. Both are required for this app to function properly. 

## Description
Use this app to track your bike rides. There are routes pre-coded into this app that you can choose from, or you can add your own custom ride. Every time you add a new ride, you can include details about the ride. If you choose a pre-coded route, it will automatically store the distance and other route details for you. On the 'Riders' page, you can see each rider with their corresponding bike rides to date. Use the 'Add Ride' page to add a new ride. You can easily edit or delete rides on the 'Riders' page. There is also a 'Goals' page, where you can keep track of any goals you have. You can easily add and delete goals as well.

## Authors
This app was created by Alessandra Chardon for the Phase 3 portfolio project of Flatiron School.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
